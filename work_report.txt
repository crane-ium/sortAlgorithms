Bugs:
-[FIXED]Some things stop working at certain size:
    -Mergesort did not work past 1 million indeces

Issues:
-One thing i ddi not account for when designing was making my algorithms
 stable sorting algorithms. Same value elements might swap places.
  -This also lessens efficiency, I believe


Notes:
-Quicksort had a ton of improvement when using the median of a
 small subset as the pivot instead. Before, time increased exponentially
 after around 50k entries.
